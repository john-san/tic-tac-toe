# TOP JavaScript Project #2: Tic Tac Toe

## Objective

This project's objective was to create a tic tac toe game.

### Project Description

**Technologies: HTML, CSS, Foundation, JavaScript**

The user has the option to player against an AI Bot or another player. Upon their selection, the user can customize their name and pick their player sign. The player with the 'X' sign will always make the first move.

If the user is playing against an AI Bot, then they can choose the difficulty level of the bot. The AI Bot has an 'impossible' difficulty which utilizes the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), making the bot impossible to defeat.

The first player to mark three spots in a row wins the game. Wins are tracked on the scoreboard. The user can click on the new game button to start a new game.

### What I learned

- I learned how to use modules and factories. This technique was helpful with namespacing and managing private variables.
- I learned about the minimax algorithm and how to implement it in my tic tac toe game.
- I learned how to work with buttons, forms, and the grid system in [foundation](https://get.foundation/index.html).
